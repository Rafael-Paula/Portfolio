**Year:** 2020  

## Project Description  

### Situation  
Lanine Intimate Fashion, a lingerie and jewelry sales business, required a customized solution to manage its sales and financial operations. The client needed a tool to streamline operations, track inventory, sales performance, and manage financial records efficiently.

### Task  
I was tasked with developing an automated, easy-to-use system that would allow the client to:
- Track sales and expenses by category (lingerie, jewelry, etc.).
- Manage financial data more effectively.
- Analyze the performance of different sales categories and sellers through reports and visual dashboards.

### Action  
To address the clientâ€™s needs, I:
- Developed a customized Excel spreadsheet with **VBA automation** to handle financial transactions, including tracking sales and expenses.
- Built automated calculations and processes to generate daily financial summaries.
- Integrated **Power BI** to create dynamic visual dashboards and reports to analyze the sales performance.
- Ensured the system could track sales across multiple sellers and categories, and automatically generate performance reports.

### Result  
The project provided Lanine Intimate Fashion with:
- A streamlined, automated system for managing sales and finances.
- Easy-to-understand reports with visual insights generated through Power BI, helping the client make informed business decisions.
- A significant reduction in the time required to manually calculate financials, allowing the client to focus more on core business operations.

# Cultivar Assessoria Agrícola

**Year**: 2021

## Project Description
I developed an automation solution for the internal processes of **Cultivar Assessoria Agrícola**, which included cash flow management, process automation, and a rural credit registration system.

---

## Situation
The company **Cultivar Assessoria Agrícola** was manually handling tobacco reports, cash flow, and rural credit registration. Each process, such as generating 11-page reports, required manual calculations, which consumed significant time and led to errors.

## Task
I was tasked with developing a solution that would automate these internal processes, reduce errors, and make the overall operation more efficient. Specifically, I needed to:
- Automate the process of generating tobacco reports.
- Create a personalized cash flow spreadsheet with dynamic dashboards.
- Implement a rural credit registration system with automatic data retrieval for client information.

## Action
1. **Automating Processes**: I used the “Mail Merge” tool in Word combined with an Excel spreadsheet to automate the generation of tobacco reports, eliminating manual calculations.
   
2. **Cash Flow Creation**: I developed a personalized Excel spreadsheet for cash flow management. The solution included dynamic dashboards that allowed clear and efficient visualization of the company’s income and expenses.

3. **Rural Credit Registration System**: I designed a system in Excel that used **VLOOKUP (PROCV)** to automatically retrieve client data and streamline the process of filling out reports and client information.

## Result
The automation solution significantly improved the efficiency of the company’s processes:
- Reduced the time spent on report generation by 80%.
- Streamlined the management of the cash flow with clear dashboards.
- Simplified the rural credit registration process with automatic data retrieval.

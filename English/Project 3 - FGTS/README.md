**Year**: 2023

## Project Description

This project aimed to process **approximately 1000 PDF pages** of tax notifications related to the **collection of the Severance Indemnity Fund for Employees (FGTS)**. These were legal documents containing critical information that needed to be accurately extracted and organized.

The challenge was that many of the PDF pages were scanned (not digital), which caused errors during data extraction. Additionally, there was a need to apply monetary correction according to legal indices and ensure that the extracted values matched those specified in the original legal files.

## Situation

The company needed to process numerous judicial documents related to the FGTS, many of which were scanned, making data extraction difficult. Furthermore, the project required monetary correction according to official indices, and the results had to match the original legal documents accurately.

## Task

I was tasked with performing **data extraction** from the correct pages of the PDFs, fixing errors caused by scanned documents, applying the necessary monetary correction using a specific index, and ensuring the final extracted values complied with the original legal documents.

Additionally, the documents had to be categorized into two main groups: **Monthly FGTS** and **Severance FGTS**, while maintaining full traceability of each file.

## Action

1. **Understanding Legal Files**:
   - I began the project by reading and understanding the **legal terms** and **judicial requirements** in the files. This enabled me to identify the correct pages within the PDFs containing the necessary information for extraction and correction.

2. **Data Extraction and Error Correction**:
   - I used **Adobe Acrobat** to extract text and tables from the PDFs. Since some documents were scanned, the initial extraction contained errors. I applied an **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** process using **Excel** to standardize the data, correct formatting issues, and fill in missing fields.

3. **Monetary Correction**:
   - I developed a spreadsheet to apply the **monetary correction** based on the required legal indices. I automated the calculations within Excel to ensure all documents were updated correctly.

4. **Value Verification**:
   - I then verified the extracted values by comparing them to the totals indicated in the legal documents. I used statistical techniques to ensure no discrepancies between the original and extracted values.

5. **Document Categorization and Organization**:
   - I categorized the documents into two groups: **Monthly FGTS** and **Severance FGTS**. This helped maintain traceability and transparency in the data validation process.

## Result

The project was successfully completed, meeting the legal expectations and ensuring the **integrity of the extracted data**. All documents were properly organized and classified, with no discrepancies between the expected and obtained values.

Additionally:
- **Traceability**: Each file can be traced back to the specific pages of the original PDF.
- **Monetary Correction**: All values were correctly adjusted according to the required indices.
- **Reliability**: All verified documents showed **zero discrepancy** between the indicated values and the final values.
